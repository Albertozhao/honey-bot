### 🧪 This is a test for using Workers with Honeycomb.io.
### 👀 Using a Discord slash command, the Worker runs on a webhook that hits the Discord API and responds with an image that the API fetches.
### 🙏 The code is mostly from this glorious package: ttps://github.com/glenstack/glenstack/tree/master/packages/cf-workers-discord-bot
